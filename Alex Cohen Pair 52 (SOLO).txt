My program will need to read in data from the log sheet and structure it into a format that can be analyzed using the following functions:


A function to count the total number of days per user when suspicious activity occurs, defined as:
* A user logs in more than 5 times in a single day;
* A user logs in between 12:00-5:00 a.m.


A function to count the number of days per user when the user engages in irresponsible behavior, defined as:
* The number of logins per user per day exceeds the number of logouts per user per day.


A function to count the total number of days when any system glitch occurs, defined as: 
* Any day in which any user has more reported logouts than logins.
   * This requires an additional function that flags any day per user when that particular user has more recorded logouts than logins.


A function to identify unique domains and count the number of users from each domain, that does the following:
* Searches the user email addresses, captures each domain when it appears for the first time, and records one user per domain; and 
* For each subsequent appearance of the domain, it increments the user count for that domain.


A function or functions will also create the required reports in the appropriate format.


I will be using dictionaries within dictionaries (nested dictionaries) to store different parts of the data from the log sheet and to store results from the respective functions.
