11/2/2020 I have uploaded flowcharts and have added code to open and read the userlog.log file
  The flowcharts are pretty straightforward, and show the basic logic for the functions that will be created for the program to interpret the log.
  I will be using dictionaries within dictionaries (nested dictionaries) to store different parts of the data from the log sheet and to store results from the respective functions.

here is a basic idea of what my refrences to the data will look like:
 “User2”: {“2020-05-23”: [event date, time, log status, server, email] } }
